# Characters

Challenge issued by **@hoiz**.

In a given array of chars, find out what character is included the most times. E.g: "A, C, C, B, B, A, C" and also print how many times it occurs. For this example it would be "C: 3". Try to do this in as low a time-complexity as possible. (This question will come in handy if you do interviews for developer jobs.)

Bonus task: Print the first occurrence of a duplicated char.
